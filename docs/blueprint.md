## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A bright, clean blue (#42A5F5) reflecting trust and stability, balanced by a white layout. It is analogous to greenish-blue and would typically not be seen together but in this instance creates a refreshing yet comforting look and feel.
- Background color: Light gray (#FAFAFA) to provide a clean and modern backdrop, as well as keep the theme light. Keeping it light creates a great reading environment for analytical users.
- Accent color: A slightly desaturated teal (#64B5F6) to highlight interactive elements, complimenting the overall color theme.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) to offer great reading comfort with an objective and neutral look.
- Modern and crisp icons from Lucide or Font Awesome, in the theme's primary blue, to provide immediate and accessible functional information.
- A clean and modern dashboard layout, with modules clearly separated using white space, leveraging Bootstrap 5 or TailwindCSS for responsiveness.
- Subtle animations for chart updates and data loading to provide visual feedback without distracting from the core content.
