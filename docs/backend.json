    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to store daily collection data and district progress for the SEMAPACH dashboard.  Authorization Independence is not a major concern in this case as there is no user specific data, and the security rules will likely be based on roles. The collections are segregated to avoid mixing different data types.  The structure prioritizes ease of querying and reporting, given the application's focus on data visualization.  The paths are straightforward to facilitate easy data access and manipulation. The design focuses on clarity and simplicity for future integration with front-end components and reporting tools. The structure uses separate collections for `daily_collections` and `district_progress` to facilitate secure `list` operations (QAPs).  This segregation ensures that listing daily collections doesn't inadvertently expose district progress data, and vice versa."
