/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SEMAPACH dashboard data.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset starts with public read access for dashboard visibility
 * and restricts write access to authenticated users only. This allows anyone
 * to view the dashboard, but only authorized personnel to manage the data.
 * As the application evolves, these rules can be tightened (e.g., role-based access).
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The database stores daily collection data and district progress in separate top-level collections.
 * - /daily_collections/{dailyCollectionId}
 * - /district_progress/{districtProgressId}
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Read access is public (`allow read;`) to allow for easy viewing of the dashboard by anyone with the link.
 * - Write access is restricted to authenticated users (`allow write: if isSignedIn();`) to prevent unauthorized data modification.
 * - No user-specific data exists yet, so rules do not rely on user-ownership patterns (`request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId`).
